Contributing to Virgo
=====================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

The Virgo Web Server from EclipseRT is a completely module-based Java application server that is designed to run enterprise Java applications and Spring-powered applications with a high degree of flexibility and reliability. It offers a simple yet comprehensive platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise Java applications.
The Virgo kernel supports the core concepts of Virgo and is not biased towards the web server, thus enabling other types of server to be created. The kernel can also be used stand-alone as a rich OSGi application platform. A server runtime can easily be constructed by deploying suitable bundles on top of the kernel.
